# Flight_Price_Intelligence
Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to analyze airline ticket pricing and classify whether a flight is expensive based on route, airline, travel class, duration, and days left before departure. The project applies exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression to uncover key pricing drivers.
