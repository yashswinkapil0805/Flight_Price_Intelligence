# Flight_Price_Intelligence

This project analyzes airline ticket pricing data to identify the factors that drive higher fares and to predict whether a flight ticket is expensive or not. Using Python and Scikit-learn, the project follows a complete data science workflow including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning classification.

Key features include converting unstructured flight duration data into numerical form, encoding categorical variables, and building a logistic regression model to classify high-priced tickets (top 25%). The analysis reveals strong pricing patterns related to travel class, days left until departure, number of stops, and airline-specific behavior, offering insights relevant to pricing analytics and revenue optimization.
